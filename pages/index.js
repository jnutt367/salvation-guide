            <h2 className={styles.chapter}>Receiving Christ? What's it Mean?</h2>
            <p>
              Many terms used in Christianity can be confusing to new believers or those seeking to know more about Jesus. One such phrase recurs often: “Receive Jesus Christ as your Savior.” What exactly does it mean to “receive” Jesus? Since Jesus lived, died, and rose again over two thousand years ago, how can we “receive” Him now?
                
                
              </p>
              <p>
                John 1:11–12 speaks of receiving Jesus and defines the term: “He [Jesus] came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him. Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God.” John equates “receiving” Jesus with “believing” in Him, which results in one’s becoming a child of God. So, receiving Jesus has to do with faith. We trust who Jesus is and what He has done on our behalf.
                </p>
            <p>
              ( Romans 10:9-10 ) 
"If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved."


              </p>




            <p>( John 1:12 )
              But to ALL who did receive Him, who believed in His name, He gave the right to be called children of God
              </p>
              <p>
                ( Mark 1:13 )
                "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand, repent and believe in the gospel"
                </p>

            <h2 className={styles.chapter}>God's Remedy For Our Sin</h2>
            <p>( Romans 6:23 )
  "For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."
              </p>
              <p>
              ( Ephesians 2:8-9 )
                "For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is NOT your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast."

            <h2 className={styles.chapter}>Do you have to be baptized?</h2>
            <p>Do you have to be baptized to go to heaven? 

While Jesus told Nicodemus, “Amen, Amen, I say to you, no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit” (John 3:5), he did not set baptism as a hindrance to salvation but just the 
opposite. We so often judge things by human standards, but God is not restrained by our standards</p>
 <p>
Clarification on the subject of salvation, I feel it to be of utmost importance wouldn't ya know it LOL....but just to be clear I DO believe that one DOES need to be BORN AGAIN
  ....and no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit. Now then, that is where it gets to the discernment part right?

So, what does he MEAN when He says "unless they are born of water and the Spirit."? Does that mean baptism? Or is being born again and baptism two separate events? I believe that they are. I know that I did NOT have to wait until I got in the water to receive a new heart, it came as soon as I first believed and called Him my savior, That moment was my salvation!!! Praise God forever and ever! Lastly, baptism IS somethhing that we NEED to do because clearly EVERYONE who becomes a disciple gets baptized if you listen to Jesus' command right at the very end of the gospel...MATTHEW 28:19 "therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit".   So it is the next logical step to be baptized after one becomes saved by calling on the name of the Lord Yeshua.

            <p>If you are not quite ready or are not sure if you want to take that leap of faith, I want to invite you to check out this blog post: <a href="https://ourkingdomculture.com/how-to-be-saved/">How to be saved.</a>

 But if you feel Jesus knocking on your heart and you are ready to say yes to Him, just talk to Him and ask Him to come in your heart and be your Lord and savior. If you need help praying here is a little prayer you can say.

DEAR GOD, I KNOW THAT I AM A SINNER AND I ASK YOU TO PLEASE FORGIVE MY SINS. I BELIEVE IN MY HEART THAT JESUS IS YOUR SON; THAT HE DIED FOR ME ON A CROSS AND YOU RAISED HIM BACK TO LIFE. JESUS, I DECLARE THAT YOU ARE MY LORD AND I OPEN MY HEART TO YOU. CHANGE ME AND HELP ME TO FOLLOW YOU ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE. HELP ME TO BE MORE LIKE YOU AND TO DO YOUR WILL.
IN JESUS’S NAME, I PRAY.
AMEN.

If you said that prayer and meant it with all your heart, then I want to be the first one to welcome you to the family of God! I promise you He is the best Father ever!!!

              Well, if you have made it this far I am assuming that Jesus has infiltrated your stubborn and rebelious heart ( dont worry I bet mine was just as stubborn as yours ) and 
              given you a new birth in His infinite wisdom through the death and resurection of His one and only son, into an inheritance that shall never fade, never spoil and never perish. God continue to bless this Disciple and give them what they have been asking for in earnest in Jesus name. Amen
