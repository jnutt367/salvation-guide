            <p>Do you have to be baptized to go to heaven? 

While Jesus told Nicodemus, “Amen, Amen, I say to you, no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit” (John 3:5), he did not set baptism as a hindrance to salvation but just the 
opposite. We so often judge things by human standards, but God is not restrained by our standards

And forgive us our debts, As we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from the evil one.</p>

            <p>If you are not quite ready or are not sure if you want to take that leap of faith, I want to invite you to check out this blog post: <a href="https://ourkingdomculture.com/how-to-be-saved/">How to be saved.</a>

 But if you feel Jesus knocking on your heart and you are ready to say yes to Him, just talk to Him and ask Him to come in your heart and be your Lord and savior. If you need help praying here is a little prayer you can say.

DEAR GOD, I KNOW THAT I AM A SINNER AND I ASK YOU TO PLEASE FORGIVE MY SINS. I BELIEVE IN MY HEART THAT JESUS IS YOUR SON; THAT HE DIED FOR ME ON A CROSS AND YOU RAISED HIM BACK TO LIFE. JESUS, I DECLARE THAT YOU ARE MY LORD AND I OPEN MY HEART TO YOU. CHANGE ME AND HELP ME TO FOLLOW YOU ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE. HELP ME TO BE MORE LIKE YOU AND TO DO YOUR WILL.
IN JESUS’S NAME, I PRAY.
AMEN.

If you said that prayer and meant it with all your heart, then I want to be the first one to welcome you to the family of God! I promise you He is the best Father ever!!!

            <p>
              Well, if you have made it this far I am assuming that Jesus has infiltrated your stubborn and rebelious heart ( dont worry I bet mine was just as stubborn as yours ) and 
              given you a new birth in His infinite wisdom through the death and resurection of His one and only son, into an inheritance that shall never fade, never spoil and never perish. God continue to bless this Disciple and give them what they have been asking for in earnest in Jesus name. Amen
